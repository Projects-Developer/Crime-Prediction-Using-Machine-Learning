## Abstract: 
This project presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting crime rates and identifying high-risk areas. By analyzing historical crime data and demographic information, the proposed model forecasts future crime trends, enabling law enforcement agencies to make data-driven decisions and allocate resources effectively. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, demonstrating its potential to improve public safety and reduce crime rates.
